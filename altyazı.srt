1
00:01:48,126 --> 00:01:50,501
"1959 Hong Kong"

2
00:01:50,584 --> 00:01:52,709
"Ip Man's older son was
studying in Foshan."

3
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:54,793
"Ip Man lived in Hong Kong with
his wife and younger son."

4
00:01:54,876 --> 00:01:57,209
"He taught Wing Chun and
promoted the martial arts."

5
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:09,626
Master Ip

6
00:02:09,667 --> 00:02:11,292
Morning!

7
00:02:12,126 --> 00:02:13,668
So early?

8
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:15,876
Master Ip, it's me.

9
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:19,417
You don't recognise me?

10
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,792
Siu Long

11
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:25,959
When I was little I asked
to study with you.

12
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:27,584
You said: grow up first.

13
00:02:27,626 --> 00:02:29,793
Please take me as a disciple.

14
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:34,251
Why should I accept you?

15
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:37,501
Because I will be your
greatest disciple.

16
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:44,959
Why are you so sure?

17
00:02:46,751 --> 00:02:48,501
Because I'm fast.

18
00:02:58,542 --> 00:02:59,584
How fast?

19
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,501
Not fast enough, kid.

20
00:03:24,501 --> 00:03:25,626
Can you be faster?

21
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:08,959
Not bad.

22
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:10,959
But did you really
kick the water

23
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,751
or only think you did?

24
00:04:45,126 --> 00:04:49,376
Licorice, licorice

25
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:04,542
Come on, somebody are fighting

26
00:05:04,584 --> 00:05:08,292
Fight! Fight!

27
00:05:08,417 --> 00:05:09,751
Come on.

28
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:12,501
Cheung Fong of Wing Chun.

29
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:14,542
Ip Ching of Wing Chun.

30
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,084
Stop! Stop fighting.

31
00:05:37,459 --> 00:05:39,626
I told you two not to fight.

32
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,959
Big trouble. It's
not the first time.

33
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:46,542
Break the shell, then
remove the yolk.

34
00:05:48,792 --> 00:05:51,001
What's with the ring?

35
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:53,334
The old folks say
that adding silver

36
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:55,626
helps with bruising.

37
00:05:57,126 --> 00:06:00,542
So, why were you fighting today?

38
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:04,751
It's always over whose
kungfu is best.

39
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,417
I should've kept an eye on them.

40
00:06:08,792 --> 00:06:10,584
What a fight, they
really got hurt.

41
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,417
It's Ching's fault.
He's so naughty.

42
00:06:13,584 --> 00:06:16,834
So, where is this boy's father?

43
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,084
Cheung Fong is new here.

44
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:22,501
His dad picks him up quite late.

45
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:25,209
Fong, what does your dad do?

46
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,959
Is he always so busy?

47
00:06:27,334 --> 00:06:28,459
Rickshaw puller.

48
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:33,626
Sorry, sorry.

49
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:35,334
- Sorry, Miss Wong.
- Master Ip

50
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:37,876
I was busy at the kungfu school

51
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:38,792
so I'm late.

52
00:06:39,084 --> 00:06:40,167
Let me see.

53
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,792
Ah Ching, what's this about?

54
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:47,751
Both kids were at fault in fact.

55
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:49,834
So I wanted all the
family heads here.

56
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,834
Right. ls Fong's dad here yet?

57
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:54,334
I need to apologise to them.

58
00:06:54,792 --> 00:06:56,876
No, like you he's late.

59
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,876
No problem, work comes first.

60
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:03,417
Don't eat that.

61
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:04,751
- You can't eat it.
- Put it down

62
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:07,042
The boy is hungry.

63
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:09,417
Miss Wong, how about this -

64
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,709
we'll give them dinner first.

65
00:07:11,834 --> 00:07:13,501
Just let his father know,

66
00:07:13,542 --> 00:07:14,376
- Okay?
- Okay.

67
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:15,792
Okay, Wing-sing?

68
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:17,042
Of course

69
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:20,542
Fong, have dinner with us, okay?

70
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,209
Take your book bag.

71
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:26,834
- Take care.
- We're off.

72
00:07:26,876 --> 00:07:27,626
Thank you

73
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,834
- Very kind, Master Ip
- Sorry to trouble you,

74
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:31,709
- Thank you, Mrs Ip.
- Bye

75
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,001
Bye

76
00:07:34,376 --> 00:07:37,376
Ah Fong, eat up, don't be shy.

77
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:38,209
Yeah,Fong!

78
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,251
Make yourself at home, eat.

79
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:41,126
Eat up.

80
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:45,376
Darling, the fish is delicious.

81
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:06,501
Cheung Fong -

82
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,209
not bad.

83
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:09,459
Who taught you?

84
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,584
My dad. Can you fight?

85
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,501
A little.

86
00:08:22,042 --> 00:08:23,126
I'm Cheung Fong's dad.

87
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:27,042
Is my son there, please?

88
00:08:27,084 --> 00:08:28,001
Yes he is.

89
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:28,626
Nice to meet you, Mr Cheung.

90
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:30,209
Please, come in.

91
00:08:36,792 --> 00:08:39,542
Fong, your dad's here.

92
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:41,042
Master.

93
00:08:42,584 --> 00:08:43,876
Disciple

94
00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:45,834
Tell me what went on today.

95
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:48,959
The kids were
naughty and fought.

96
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:51,292
They'll learn in time.

97
00:08:51,834 --> 00:08:53,459
Come here, Ah Ching.

98
00:08:54,584 --> 00:08:55,376
Disciple

99
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,542
Aren't you going to apologise?

100
00:08:57,626 --> 00:08:59,292
Ah Ching is at fault too.

101
00:08:59,584 --> 00:09:01,376
Ip Ching, I'm sorry.

102
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,834
I'm sorry, Cheung Fong.

103
00:09:03,917 --> 00:09:05,751
Shake hands.

104
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:07,792
Now you're friends.

105
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,917
I've taken you out of your way.

106
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:15,001
I apologise, Mr Cheung.

107
00:09:16,126 --> 00:09:19,042
Good to meet you, Master Ip.

108
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:21,751
I saw Fong working
the wooden man.

109
00:09:21,792 --> 00:09:24,334
He's good - he's
been taught well.

110
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,376
Too kind.

111
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:27,959
But it's late.

112
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,417
You should rest.

113
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:30,834
I'll see you off.

114
00:09:35,167 --> 00:09:36,667
Master

115
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:39,376
Uncle Ip has a wooden man too

116
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:41,334
Do you know him?

117
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:42,751
Yes.

118
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:45,459
Uncle Ip is very famous.

119
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,209
But one day

120
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:49,334
I'll be more famous.

121
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,001
Which of you

122
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:54,042
is better at kungfu?

123
00:09:54,501 --> 00:09:55,751
Who do you think?

124
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:58,876
You of course!

125
00:10:01,584 --> 00:10:02,709
Let's go.

126
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:05,751
Give me a look... does it hurt?

127
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,251
No

128
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:11,251
It's about to start.

129
00:10:11,292 --> 00:10:13,001
Hurry! Hurry!

130
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:14,417
Bet on the winner.

131
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:16,792
- I told you, follow my lead.
- Great.

132
00:10:16,876 --> 00:10:18,959
One at a time!

133
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:21,126
Bigger bets, bigger wins.

134
00:10:21,417 --> 00:10:23,126
Move, outta the way.

135
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:32,542
Cheung Tin Chi, Cheung Tin Chi

136
00:10:51,001 --> 00:10:52,626
How are you doing?

137
00:10:59,334 --> 00:11:01,084
Come on, come on.

138
00:11:03,126 --> 00:11:05,042
Brother Sang, Brother Sang.

139
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,542
- The boss is here.
- What?

140
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:08,209
The boss is here.

141
00:11:10,376 --> 00:11:11,626
Not bad, kid.

142
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:12,917
Go.

143
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,126
Hit hard, fast.

144
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:20,167
Hey boss.

145
00:11:23,167 --> 00:11:24,459
Come on.

146
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:27,667
- Wait here, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

147
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:39,792
Boss -

148
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,459
don't worry,

149
00:11:42,667 --> 00:11:46,709
I've got it under control.

150
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,334
Two week's money.

151
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,209
- Open it.
- Okay.

152
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:57,959
You did good.

153
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,334
- Thank you.
- What about that other business?

154
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:01,751
The school?

155
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,876
No problem. Give me one month.

156
00:12:04,084 --> 00:12:05,959
No. Two weeks.

157
00:12:06,167 --> 00:12:07,501
C'mon...

158
00:12:09,417 --> 00:12:11,209
Okay, I love a challenge.

159
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:12,959
Deal you

160
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:17,084
Remember, I want that school.

161
00:12:17,126 --> 00:12:19,042
The rest means
nothing without it.

162
00:12:19,126 --> 00:12:21,334
Yes. Understood.

163
00:12:26,292 --> 00:12:27,917
What kind of kungfu is that?

164
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:29,542
Wing Chun.

165
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:31,251
It's really powerful.

166
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,542
Martial artists come
here every day.

167
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:49,459
We chat, drink tea...

168
00:12:49,667 --> 00:12:52,751
Each school has its own table.

169
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:55,167
Master Tin.

170
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,917
- Master Chan, a rising star -
- Master Tin.

171
00:12:58,376 --> 00:13:01,042
He has a lot of students.

172
00:13:01,501 --> 00:13:02,834
Master Chan.

173
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:04,501
Now this table is amazing -

174
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,667
the best of the best.

175
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:08,209
It's my table.

176
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:09,292
Master Tin.

177
00:13:09,334 --> 00:13:10,667
Just kidding.

178
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:12,417
The real champions sit there -

179
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,917
That's the Wing Chun table.

180
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:16,542
Master Tin.

181
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:19,167
Ah Lik, where's your master?

182
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,209
There he is.

183
00:13:23,751 --> 00:13:24,542
Master Ip.

184
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:28,001
Master Tin, have you eaten?

185
00:13:28,084 --> 00:13:29,584
No - your treat?

186
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:31,251
Of course!

187
00:13:31,334 --> 00:13:33,584
You know Master Ip, of course?

188
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,251
- Master Ip, hello. I'm Lee.
- How do you do.

189
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:36,417
- Mr Lee.
- Hello.

190
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:38,709
Lee is a reporter, and keen

191
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,876
to write about the martial arts.

192
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,334
He'll take photos too.

193
00:13:42,417 --> 00:13:43,876
- Great.
- Okay with you, Master Ip?

194
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:45,001
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.

195
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,584
- Master Lee, right here.
- Too kind.

196
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:49,167
- Ip Man, the center seat.
- No, no.

197
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:51,209
- It's yours.
- No, really.

198
00:13:51,251 --> 00:13:52,751
No it's fitting, sit down.

199
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:55,251
Master Ip, telephone.

200
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,459
I'll take that if it's okay.

201
00:13:57,501 --> 00:13:58,876
Sure

202
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:00,667
we'll save your seat.

203
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:02,001
We'll wait.

204
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,251
Hello?

205
00:14:05,084 --> 00:14:07,084
Did you forget our date?

206
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:09,126
Wasn't it for...

207
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:10,959
<i>For today.</i>

208
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:12,584
Today“.

209
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,459
Oh, I'll rush right over.

210
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:16,001
I've been waiting an hour.

211
00:14:16,042 --> 00:14:17,917
The dancing is almost finished.

212
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,251
So don't bother.

213
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:21,417
Just pick up Ah
Ching from school.

214
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:32,751
Oh, I'm in trouble.

215
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:35,626
- Master Ip, please.
- Sit down.

216
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,209
Here, the middle seat.

217
00:14:38,251 --> 00:14:40,459
- Okay, I give in.
- And why not.

218
00:14:40,501 --> 00:14:42,584
Look sharp, eyes
front, hold still!

219
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:43,542
Ready“.

220
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:45,542
One, two, three.

221
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:51,792
Master Ip,

222
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:54,001
- Hello.
- you're here for your son?

223
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,292
Where's your wife?

224
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:56,584
She's busy today.

225
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,126
And you're not?

226
00:14:58,209 --> 00:14:59,626
It's okay...

227
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:02,751
Master Ip, you look
younger by the day.

228
00:15:03,584 --> 00:15:05,584
Must be his wife's cooking -

229
00:15:05,709 --> 00:15:07,167
such tender meat.

230
00:15:07,209 --> 00:15:09,834
Such a lucky couple.

231
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:11,292
Master Ip

232
00:15:13,042 --> 00:15:14,292
Mr Cheung

233
00:15:14,334 --> 00:15:16,042
- hello.
- Hello.

234
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:20,001
- Picking up your son?
- Yes.

235
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:21,876
Oh,

236
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:24,876
this medicine helps
with bruises.

237
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,417
It's for your son.

238
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:28,584
Thank you, that's so nice.

239
00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:30,001
How is Fong?

240
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:31,042
He's fine.

241
00:15:31,084 --> 00:15:32,459
I'm glad.

242
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,334
Master Ip -

243
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:37,917
I hear you studied

244
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,001
with Chan Wah Shun, yes?

245
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:40,792
Yes.

246
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,334
So we're both from the school

247
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,959
of Foshan's Grandmaster
Leung Jan.

248
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:49,751
So we are truly
brothers-in-arms.

249
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,334
I heard that

250
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,584
Chan used fist and pole

251
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:56,292
better than swords and feet.

252
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:57,001
Is that true?

253
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,667
Having strengths
and weaknesses -

254
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:03,501
It's normal.

255
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:05,042
How about you, Master Ip?

256
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,584
I'm just a dabbler.

257
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:14,959
If we have the chance,

258
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:17,376
let's have a friendly match.

259
00:16:20,584 --> 00:16:21,792
Sure.

260
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:27,417
BYE, Miss!

261
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:29,667
Be careful.

262
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:30,376
Master.

263
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:31,834
Disciple -

264
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:35,792
What did you learn today?

265
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,834
- Mathematics.
- Mathematics?

266
00:16:37,876 --> 00:16:39,792
Chinese, English.

267
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:40,792
How'd you do?

268
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,042
- Did you behave?
- That's all.

269
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,251
Yes.

270
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,501
D'you go to school?

271
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:52,959
<i>NU?-.</i>

272
00:16:54,876 --> 00:16:55,667
Principal

273
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:57,917
this man is asking for you.

274
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,376
How may I help you?

275
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:01,751
- Hey - Move it!

276
00:17:01,834 --> 00:17:04,417
- What's going on?
- Sit, don't move.

277
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,167
- Don't move.
- Looking at me?

278
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:07,709
Fatty, calm down!

279
00:17:07,792 --> 00:17:09,959
How can I talk over your noise?

280
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,876
So sorry, sir, we
gave you a fright.

281
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:13,834
- What's going on?
- Come, sit down.

282
00:17:13,876 --> 00:17:15,417
Make room.

283
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:17,042
Don't be afraid.

284
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,042
You're a scholar,
I'm a gentleman.

285
00:17:20,126 --> 00:17:21,834
We're reasonable people.

286
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:24,209
This is prime real estate.

287
00:17:24,917 --> 00:17:26,126
Sell your school to me.

288
00:17:26,167 --> 00:17:26,792
It's a fair offer.

289
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:27,542
"Contract of Sale"

290
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:29,626
I'm not selling.

291
00:17:29,709 --> 00:17:31,042
Won't you even read it first?

292
00:17:31,084 --> 00:17:31,959
Go on.

293
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,042
I'm not selling.

294
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:37,001
Educated people are a pain.

295
00:17:42,209 --> 00:17:43,834
They don't do as told.

296
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:53,542
Watch out, Boss.

297
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:57,626
What's going on?

298
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:00,501
They're forcing me
to sell the school.

299
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,459
Think I don't know kungfu?

300
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:11,584
Ip Man, it's a business deal-

301
00:18:16,167 --> 00:18:19,001
keep your damn nose out of it.

302
00:18:19,084 --> 00:18:21,042
Hello, this is Chi
yan Primary School.

303
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:23,334
We need police here right now.

304
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:25,792
Some thugs are causing trouble.

305
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:29,626
- Cut it out.
- Let him go.

306
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:31,292
Let my boss go

307
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:33,501
or I'll whack her.

308
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:36,376
- Let my boss go, now!
- Let him go

309
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:38,376
- Do it!
- Let him go

310
00:18:39,334 --> 00:18:41,001
Don't rush, take your time.

311
00:18:41,126 --> 00:18:43,417
Start from the beginning.

312
00:18:44,626 --> 00:18:46,209
The three just barged in

313
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,709
and began smashing things up.

314
00:18:48,709 --> 00:18:51,251
Hong Kong seems prosperous

315
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:52,751
but really it's a mess.

316
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:55,001
More wealth means more crime.

317
00:18:55,209 --> 00:18:57,792
We're like Cyclops
and his wife -

318
00:18:57,834 --> 00:18:58,709
can't always keep an eye on her.

319
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:00,334
Truth is, we're understaffed

320
00:19:00,376 --> 00:19:02,292
- and insanely busy.
- You're right

321
00:19:02,334 --> 00:19:04,834
Hongkong's crime
rate is going up.

322
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:05,834
It seems pretty lawless.

323
00:19:06,167 --> 00:19:08,042
No, we still have law.

324
00:19:08,084 --> 00:19:09,751
Call the police

325
00:19:09,834 --> 00:19:11,084
and we come.

326
00:19:11,126 --> 00:19:12,501
We'll crack this case.

327
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,126
The bastards won't
get away with it.

328
00:19:14,167 --> 00:19:15,209
Yes, yes.

329
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:17,209
We're relying on you, Sgt. Po.

330
00:19:17,334 --> 00:19:19,376
Of course, it's my duty.

331
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:20,459
But Master Ip

332
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:21,667
you know the score.

333
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:24,501
The police can't keep
watch here all day.

334
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:25,542
We need your help.

335
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,251
Tell people to be careful.

336
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,459
- I will.
- Anything happens, call us.

337
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,542
- I'll come straightaway. Okay?
- Great, thank you.

338
00:19:31,626 --> 00:19:33,667
- You're welcome. Let's go, men.
- Yes, sir.

339
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:34,626
- See you.
- Take care.

340
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:35,709
Bye.

341
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:45,667
Ip Man,

342
00:19:47,126 --> 00:19:48,959
you piss me off.

343
00:19:49,876 --> 00:19:51,959
I'm gonna do you slowly.

344
00:19:53,042 --> 00:19:53,959
David.

345
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:55,584
Brother Sang

346
00:19:58,292 --> 00:20:00,751
Chain up the school tonight.

347
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,209
Don't worry.

348
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:04,667
It'll be okay.

349
00:20:05,459 --> 00:20:07,042
It's okay.

350
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,792
Don't worry -

351
00:20:11,751 --> 00:20:12,917
the school won't shut.

352
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:14,584
Principal!

353
00:20:15,792 --> 00:20:17,209
Principal!

354
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,209
<i>Miss Wong</i>

355
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:20,376
Master Ip

356
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:21,167
Miss Wong -

357
00:20:21,209 --> 00:20:21,751
Master Ip

358
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:22,834
what's going on?

359
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,792
It was like this
when I got here.

360
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,792
Will they demolish the school?

361
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:29,834
How will our kids
get an education?

362
00:20:40,667 --> 00:20:42,709
Dad, open the gate.

363
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:45,459
I'll help you - careful.

364
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:50,667
You're really strong.

365
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:51,959
Can't I be skinny and strong?

366
00:20:54,376 --> 00:20:55,876
Sure.

367
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:57,376
I'm big but not that strong.

368
00:20:58,792 --> 00:20:59,584
My name is Hui Lik.

369
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,251
They call me Miss Wong.

370
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:03,167
Call me if you need help.

371
00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:08,126
Come in,

372
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,626
Morning, granny.

373
00:21:10,334 --> 00:21:12,667
Morning, Principal.

374
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:13,667
Morning, Miss Wong.

375
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:14,959
Morning.

376
00:21:15,709 --> 00:21:16,584
Master

377
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:19,667
Let's

378
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,542
They'll be back for sure.

379
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:27,917
Then wait here for them.

380
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:29,667
Okay.

381
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:33,709
Tonight we're staying here.

382
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:34,709
Good.

383
00:22:00,334 --> 00:22:02,667
Miss Wong, funny
meeting you again.

384
00:22:02,917 --> 00:22:04,376
Yes, can I help you?

385
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:05,251
No-.

386
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:07,167
May I ask, do you
have a boyfriend?

387
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:09,584
No-.

388
00:22:10,126 --> 00:22:11,251
Great.

389
00:22:11,292 --> 00:22:12,876
Would you like a boyfriend?

390
00:22:14,584 --> 00:22:16,334
Haven't thought about it.

391
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:19,292
Don't get me wrong...
but it's dark.

392
00:22:19,334 --> 00:22:21,334
You shouldn't walk home alone.

393
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:25,084
I'm sorry.

394
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:27,209
Master Ip

395
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:29,209
Hello, Miss Wong.

396
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:32,084
We've put you to a
lot of trouble.

397
00:22:32,126 --> 00:22:33,084
It's nothing.

398
00:22:35,626 --> 00:22:37,792
Is my disciple
giving you trouble?

399
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:39,292
No, Master Ip.

400
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:40,876
Not at all.

401
00:22:40,917 --> 00:22:43,417
He kindly offered
to see me home.

402
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:45,042
That's all it was, Master.

403
00:22:46,584 --> 00:22:48,834
Why don't you see me home then?

404
00:22:49,376 --> 00:22:50,501
Okay.

405
00:22:51,126 --> 00:22:53,084
Hey, let's see Master
Ip home tonight.

406
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:54,209
Sure, it's pretty quiet.

407
00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:55,126
Okay.

408
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:57,667
Master Ip, you did a
lot for us today.

409
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,126
You should get some rest.

410
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:00,084
I'm fine.

411
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:02,042
I didn't have any other plans.

412
00:23:07,709 --> 00:23:08,751
HEY

413
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:12,417
Hurry.

414
00:23:13,917 --> 00:23:14,959
You guys, over there!

415
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:48,917
- Help, Master Ip!
- Take him.

416
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:50,126
Help!

417
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:50,834
Protect Miss Wong!

418
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:09,751
Okay?

419
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:11,167
Yup, but we're definitely
seeing you home.

420
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:11,709
UP there!

421
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:12,417
Okay.

422
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:31,542
Help!

423
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:33,876
Move.

424
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,209
Let's go, men.

425
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:03,626
We checked everywhere;
the fire's out.

426
00:26:03,667 --> 00:26:05,376
Make sure there's
no live embers.

427
00:26:05,417 --> 00:26:06,001
Okay.

428
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:07,542
- Go double-check.
- Okay.

429
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:11,417
Master,

430
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:12,834
the fire's extinguished.

431
00:26:12,876 --> 00:26:14,751
But nothing's left but ash.

432
00:26:15,626 --> 00:26:17,459
Principal,

433
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:19,001
are you okay?

434
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:20,959
I'm fine.

435
00:26:21,001 --> 00:26:23,292
But I underestimated
those thugs.

436
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:25,751
Lucky you and your
men were here.

437
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:29,667
- It was nothing.
- Thank you so much, Master Ip.

438
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:35,084
Mr Cheung,

439
00:26:37,584 --> 00:26:38,751
thank goodness you were there.

440
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:40,626
I was just passing by

441
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:43,751
I've finally seen
your Wing Chun.

442
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:44,834
It's as good as they say.

443
00:26:45,001 --> 00:26:46,376
People are too nice.

444
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,501
If all's Well

445
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:48,751
I'll get back to work.

446
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:52,251
Bye.

447
00:26:57,292 --> 00:27:01,292
The people want me to stay

448
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:03,084
and help guard the area.

449
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:06,292
It's arson, aren't
the cops involved?

450
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,042
Yes, why wouldn't they be?

451
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:11,292
'Fatty' Po says they'll
crack the case.

452
00:27:11,876 --> 00:27:14,709
We've no reason to
doubt his word.

453
00:27:14,751 --> 00:27:16,001
That's good.

454
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:20,417
But they can't give
24-hour protection.

455
00:27:22,042 --> 00:27:23,167
So

456
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:24,876
for a few nights

457
00:27:24,917 --> 00:27:27,751
I might be out late.

458
00:27:28,251 --> 00:27:29,917
Should I cook dinner then?

459
00:27:29,959 --> 00:27:31,001
Sure,

460
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:32,584
what'll I eat otherwise?

461
00:27:34,709 --> 00:27:36,251
They can't do it without you?

462
00:27:37,167 --> 00:27:38,292
It's not that.

463
00:27:38,709 --> 00:27:40,709
But if I can help I will.

464
00:27:42,917 --> 00:27:43,792
It's working.

465
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:45,751
Then do me a favour
- turn it off.

466
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,709
So sorry, so sorry -

467
00:27:54,751 --> 00:27:55,917
I was having dinner.

468
00:27:55,959 --> 00:27:57,376
Come in, have a look.

469
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:05,959
Come, have a look.

470
00:28:07,459 --> 00:28:09,834
The place has great fengshui.

471
00:28:09,876 --> 00:28:11,417
It's an oasis of calm.

472
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:13,876
So the Wall's a bit chipped -

473
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:16,626
you can sweep it clean.

474
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:20,251
Disciple

475
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:23,042
I'll open my kungfu school here.

476
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:25,626
You'll have lots of
classmates then.

477
00:28:25,667 --> 00:28:26,167
Is that good?

478
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:28,667
Great! I'll be able to practice

479
00:28:28,709 --> 00:28:31,251
here and here and here!

480
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:33,834
How much is a month's rent?

481
00:28:33,876 --> 00:28:36,542
HK$180. Water and
electricity included.

482
00:28:37,167 --> 00:28:39,584
I'll think it over. Thank you.

483
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:43,876
Sir, the rent is negotiable.

484
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:48,626
You pull a rickshaw?!

485
00:28:49,834 --> 00:28:52,209
And you're going
to run a school?

486
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:53,834
AS if!

487
00:28:55,001 --> 00:28:56,126
- You're wasting my time.
- Where to, boss?

488
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:56,917
Home.

489
00:28:56,959 --> 00:28:58,334
Loser

490
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:07,501
Sir, my report on the
school arson case.

491
00:29:07,542 --> 00:29:08,542
Then wait here for them.

492
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:10,501
Sign and I'll follow up.

493
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:16,001
Not necessary. I'm handling it.

494
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:17,792
Don't be silly,
it's a small case.

495
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:19,209
Too small for you, sir.

496
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:21,126
Let me handle it, okay?

497
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,001
Do you understand Chinese?

498
00:29:24,917 --> 00:29:27,376
The investigation
into the school-

499
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:28,834
I will take care of it

500
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:30,917
because I am in charge.

501
00:29:32,626 --> 00:29:34,376
So piss off.

502
00:29:34,751 --> 00:29:35,584
Get

503
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:37,376
out

504
00:29:38,584 --> 00:29:39,709
Yes, sir.

505
00:29:45,126 --> 00:29:45,751
What the hell-

506
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,251
you blind?

507
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:49,292
What's it to you?
You own the road?

508
00:29:49,334 --> 00:29:50,459
Idiot.

509
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:52,459
- Here comes more.
- You at it again?

510
00:29:58,959 --> 00:29:59,751
Brother.

511
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:00,709
Thanks.

512
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:02,667
Brother.

513
00:30:03,167 --> 00:30:04,626
When I was at tea this morning

514
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:05,959
people were saying

515
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:07,584
we'd become security guards.

516
00:30:07,751 --> 00:30:11,292
Oh, don't worry about it.

517
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:13,459
Master Ip doesn't
listen to gossip.

518
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:16,542
Who said it anyway?

519
00:30:17,584 --> 00:30:19,001
Lots of people.

520
00:30:19,042 --> 00:30:20,501
Would you recognise them?

521
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:23,084
Mantis?

522
00:30:41,459 --> 00:30:42,626
How can I help you?

523
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:45,834
I often have pain in my abdomen.

524
00:30:45,876 --> 00:30:47,459
Do you have anything for it?

525
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:48,417
Yes,

526
00:30:49,834 --> 00:30:50,834
Crow And Phoenix Pills.

527
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:52,126
They help circulate.

528
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,584
Okay, I'll have a packet.

529
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:06,751
- Ip Man.
- Hi

530
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:07,917
- Why didn't you tell me
- Master Tin, have a seat.

531
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:08,751
What happened?

532
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:10,292
Have a seat.

533
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:13,584
They're saying at the tea house

534
00:31:13,626 --> 00:31:15,084
you've become a security guard.

535
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,209
That's so insulting.

536
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:18,917
I bet it's that little
bastard's doing.

537
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,084
Have some tea.

538
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:23,959
I rue the day I made
Ah Sang a disciple.

539
00:31:24,334 --> 00:31:26,292
He uses my kungfu
to do awful things.

540
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:27,876
It's disgraceful!

541
00:31:28,042 --> 00:31:29,626
He shames my school!

542
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:33,959
See -

543
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:35,459
how could I tell you?

544
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:37,209
Well I'm telling you -

545
00:31:37,251 --> 00:31:38,834
I'll teach him a lesson!

546
00:31:39,001 --> 00:31:40,459
I'm going after him.

547
00:31:40,709 --> 00:31:42,126
Master Tin.

548
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:44,001
Master Tin, calm down.

549
00:31:44,126 --> 00:31:46,084
Uncle Chan, I'll pay for this.

550
00:31:46,584 --> 00:31:47,292
Master Tin

551
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:49,751
Master Tin.

552
00:31:49,876 --> 00:31:51,501
Let Sgt. Po handle it.

553
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,792
Too late for that.

554
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,709
I'll take care of this myself.

555
00:31:55,751 --> 00:31:57,792
That little shit
owes me respect.

556
00:31:58,084 --> 00:32:00,376
He's no longer your
responsibility.

557
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:02,501
It's true that he left my school

558
00:32:02,751 --> 00:32:05,084
but I'm still his teacher.

559
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,876
Don't fret, I'll be fine.

560
00:32:06,917 --> 00:32:08,292
Stop. What d'ya want?

561
00:32:08,584 --> 00:32:10,376
I'm looking for Ma King Sang

562
00:32:10,417 --> 00:32:12,501
I'm his teacher. Call him out.

563
00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:20,542
Sgt.

564
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:24,751
Ah-Lik, where's Master Ip?

565
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:26,417
Too late for that.

566
00:32:26,459 --> 00:32:27,542
Master Tin was really furious.

567
00:32:27,584 --> 00:32:28,626
Not sure why.

568
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:29,667
Master Tin?

569
00:32:30,376 --> 00:32:32,626
Now what?

570
00:32:35,542 --> 00:32:36,417
Why are you here,

571
00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:37,834
Master Ip?

572
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:41,917
So I see my teacher.
What's it to you?

573
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:43,459
Master.

574
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:44,542
Sang,

575
00:32:44,917 --> 00:32:46,334
leave Master Ip out of this.

576
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:47,834
It's my idea to come here.

577
00:32:48,459 --> 00:32:50,292
Stop causing so much trouble.

578
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:53,251
Leave those people
alone, give it up.

579
00:32:53,459 --> 00:32:54,917
I always taught you

580
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:57,209
to do the right thing.

581
00:32:57,251 --> 00:32:58,292
Look at yourself.

582
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:00,042
Know what you look like?

583
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:03,251
Dirty money and a
pack of thugs -

584
00:33:03,292 --> 00:33:05,167
really grand, you are!

585
00:33:05,209 --> 00:33:07,126
Think about it - if
you didn't pay them

586
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:08,751
would they still be there?

587
00:33:09,126 --> 00:33:10,417
When you're around,

588
00:33:10,459 --> 00:33:11,584
they bow and scrape.

589
00:33:11,626 --> 00:33:12,959
Behind your back

590
00:33:13,001 --> 00:33:15,084
they call you the foreign
devil's flunkey.

591
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:17,876
What? You want to fight me?

592
00:33:20,459 --> 00:33:21,917
So I'm a flunkey -

593
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,042
A flunkey with money

594
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:25,834
is as good as a king.

595
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:26,917
And you?

596
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:29,876
A poor teacher, so pure -

597
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:32,501
you have to repair
umbrellas to eat.

598
00:33:32,542 --> 00:33:33,959
Does that feel good?

599
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:37,792
You can't eat purity, can you?

600
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:39,709
Ask yourself-

601
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:43,001
Which of your students
still remember you?

602
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:44,959
Which still care about you?

603
00:33:45,751 --> 00:33:47,251
All of them,

604
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,709
they're with me now.

605
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:50,792
Bastard!

606
00:34:06,751 --> 00:34:08,667
You'd stab me?

607
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:12,917
You thug! You want to kill me?

608
00:34:13,626 --> 00:34:16,251
Hurt me and you won't escape.

609
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:20,126
Men, over here!

610
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:33,251
- Free Ah Sang!
- Don't worry about me.

611
00:34:33,626 --> 00:34:34,792
Attack!

612
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:36,917
Fight, brothers!

613
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:40,084
C'mon!

614
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:41,834
Free Ah Sang!

615
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:43,751
Free Ah Sang!

616
00:34:47,709 --> 00:34:49,126
Police, stop it!

617
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,501
Get back, get back.

618
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:54,251
Get back

619
00:34:57,042 --> 00:34:58,209
Go home.

620
00:34:59,292 --> 00:35:00,709
Move and I'll shoot.

621
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:08,834
You playing with me?

622
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:10,376
Get out.

623
00:35:10,417 --> 00:35:11,792
Say What?

624
00:35:11,834 --> 00:35:12,917
Now you give the orders?

625
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,542
Know who owns this patch?

626
00:35:14,584 --> 00:35:17,542
Gonna shoot me? Well?

627
00:35:17,917 --> 00:35:20,001
What'll you tell
your captain then?

628
00:35:24,459 --> 00:35:25,542
Shut up or I'll arrest you.

629
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:26,917
I'll seal off this whole place.

630
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,792
See what you tell
your boss then!

631
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:30,501
Don't believe me?

632
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:31,917
Just try me, you bastard!

633
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:46,001
What'll you do about the school?

634
00:35:48,251 --> 00:35:50,417
Sang's boss has my
captain in his pocket.

635
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:52,959
The two foreign devils

636
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:54,917
are in cahoots.

637
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:57,042
It's hopeless. The
school is doomed.

638
00:35:57,584 --> 00:35:59,001
Fatty, I trust you

639
00:35:59,417 --> 00:36:02,459
because you're not
like other cops.

640
00:36:02,917 --> 00:36:04,709
But one word from a foreigner

641
00:36:04,751 --> 00:36:05,751
and you drop the case?

642
00:36:05,792 --> 00:36:08,834
It's not that, it's pointless.

643
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,917
So you didn't
arrest the arsonist

644
00:36:11,292 --> 00:36:14,167
or look after the
people and the kids.

645
00:36:14,501 --> 00:36:16,084
And now my disciples

646
00:36:16,126 --> 00:36:17,626
are doing your work for you.

647
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:19,209
What else can I do?

648
00:36:19,667 --> 00:36:20,876
What else can I do?

649
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:23,542
Master Ip, you're a
fighter, not a god.

650
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:25,292
Too late for that.

651
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,792
You guard the school
day and night-

652
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:29,584
but for how long?

653
00:36:29,751 --> 00:36:32,751
You know foreign
devils run Hongkong.

654
00:36:34,584 --> 00:36:36,251
The world's not fair.

655
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:39,376
But moral standards
apply to all.

656
00:36:39,834 --> 00:36:42,917
The ruler isn't always
a superior person.

657
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,334
And the ruled isn't
always inferior.

658
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:48,167
The world doesn't
belong to the rich

659
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:50,292
or even the powerful

660
00:36:50,459 --> 00:36:52,167
but to those of pure heart.

661
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:54,251
Have you thought
of the children?

662
00:36:54,626 --> 00:36:56,542
All that we do,

663
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:58,501
they're watching.

664
00:36:59,042 --> 00:37:02,501
We need to be good role models.

665
00:37:03,459 --> 00:37:04,626
All that we do,

666
00:37:05,417 --> 00:37:06,876
is not for today

667
00:37:07,209 --> 00:37:08,834
but for tomorrow.

668
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:44,167
"Toss it if you don't want it."

669
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:21,376
"Please sew on the button."

670
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:58,334
"Please sew on the button."

671
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:12,667
Mrs Ip, my initial diagnosis

672
00:39:12,709 --> 00:39:14,667
is to suspect a tumor.

673
00:39:14,709 --> 00:39:16,584
It's not very encouraging.

674
00:39:16,626 --> 00:39:17,792
But we'll learn more

675
00:39:17,834 --> 00:39:19,917
once we have the full report.

676
00:39:20,042 --> 00:39:21,834
Try not to worry too much.

677
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:44,001
Master Ip

678
00:39:44,084 --> 00:39:45,001
Master Ip, Master Ip

679
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:46,417
You work so hard.

680
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:51,459
Master Ip, We all pitched
in for the soup.

681
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:52,584
- Enjoy it - Thank you

682
00:39:52,626 --> 00:39:54,542
You're here night and day.

683
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:56,084
You need sustenance.

684
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:57,084
Where are your disciples?

685
00:39:57,126 --> 00:39:58,334
They should have some too.

686
00:39:58,376 --> 00:39:59,709
Thank you, thank you.

687
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:12,334
I had told you the
blue one is better,

688
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:15,042
but you still buy the red one.

689
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:16,834
Great, great, another win.

690
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:19,626
So many fights -
what's the deal?

691
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,584
Need money?

692
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,751
It's a living.

693
00:40:22,709 --> 00:40:24,459
I need to eat too.

694
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:26,792
That time at the school,

695
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:28,501
you hurt my men.

696
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:30,126
You owe me.

697
00:40:33,084 --> 00:40:34,501
How much do I owe?

698
00:40:36,084 --> 00:40:37,334
It's not about that.

699
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,792
I admire you.

700
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:43,542
I wanna be your friend.

701
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:48,667
Sang, what's this about?

702
00:40:49,876 --> 00:40:51,167
I'm talking about

703
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:52,959
the kind of friendship

704
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:55,084
that pushes another
mam to the wall.

705
00:40:55,126 --> 00:40:57,834
I'm buying a man's hand here.

706
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:00,542
You've so many men -

707
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,751
why do you need me?

708
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:04,417
Because he knows kungfu

709
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:06,542
and so do you.

710
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:08,334
And you fight well.

711
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:13,792
And if I say no?

712
00:41:19,209 --> 00:41:20,876
Then go elsewhere for a crust.

713
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:24,876
The blue? Hand it over.

714
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:26,834
You won? Give it here.

715
00:41:28,792 --> 00:41:29,501
Ah Sang -

716
00:41:33,417 --> 00:41:34,334
That money -

717
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:35,584
I want it all.

718
00:42:59,584 --> 00:43:01,542
How many more days of this?

719
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,417
You're up?

720
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:09,501
I didn't want to wake you.

721
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:11,584
Just a few more days.

722
00:43:13,084 --> 00:43:15,084
When will you eat at home again?

723
00:43:15,626 --> 00:43:16,626
Tonight.

724
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:18,626
I'll come back earlier.

725
00:43:22,292 --> 00:43:23,126
Are you okay?

726
00:43:26,876 --> 00:43:27,709
Well...

727
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:31,584
- Hello - Hello? Master Ip?

728
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:32,626
Yes, who's this?

729
00:43:33,334 --> 00:43:34,709
Kowloon Hospital.

730
00:43:34,751 --> 00:43:35,792
What is it?

731
00:43:35,834 --> 00:43:38,459
Master Tin has
been badly wounded

732
00:43:38,501 --> 00:43:40,167
and he wants to see you.

733
00:43:41,126 --> 00:43:42,792
Okay, I'll be right there.

734
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:44,834
I made the call.

735
00:43:45,667 --> 00:43:46,834
Thank you.

736
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:54,001
Let's get to work.

737
00:44:00,042 --> 00:44:01,251
Very good.

738
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:03,126
Go play.

739
00:44:10,084 --> 00:44:12,292
Luckily it's only a hand injury.

740
00:44:12,334 --> 00:44:14,584
It could've been a lot worse.

741
00:44:17,417 --> 00:44:18,501
Thank you.

742
00:44:18,542 --> 00:44:21,292
Ah Sang sent him for sure.

743
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:25,667
As a teacher, I'm
a total failure.

744
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:27,626
Let's get some!

745
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:28,959
Yes, this one!

746
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:30,292
Kids,

747
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:33,292
I have some cartoon slides

748
00:44:33,334 --> 00:44:34,417
want to see them?

749
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:37,584
It's free.

750
00:44:37,626 --> 00:44:39,251
C'mon.

751
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:40,376
Hey!

752
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:44,417
- Hurry - What're you doing?

753
00:44:44,459 --> 00:44:46,042
- Help, help - Help, me

754
00:44:46,084 --> 00:44:46,751
Hey!

755
00:44:48,084 --> 00:44:49,042
Take him

756
00:44:49,126 --> 00:44:50,501
What're you doing?

757
00:44:51,042 --> 00:44:52,626
- Enjoy - Help me.

758
00:45:05,126 --> 00:45:06,542
You've got two hours.

759
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:08,667
Get the principal
to the shipyard

760
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:11,917
or I sell the kids into slavery.

761
00:45:13,876 --> 00:45:15,959
How'd you know I
was in hospital?

762
00:45:16,001 --> 00:45:17,459
You told them to call me.

763
00:45:17,501 --> 00:45:18,084
No I didn't.

764
00:45:18,126 --> 00:45:18,959
You didn't?

765
00:45:29,834 --> 00:45:31,542
Mrs Ip, where's Master Ip?

766
00:45:31,584 --> 00:45:32,626
What is it?

767
00:45:34,542 --> 00:45:36,626
Tell me what happened?

768
00:45:37,834 --> 00:45:38,917
Master Ip!

769
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:40,334
What is it, Miss Wong?

770
00:45:40,376 --> 00:45:43,042
A man abducted Ching,
Fong and other kids.

771
00:45:43,084 --> 00:45:43,917
What?

772
00:45:44,751 --> 00:45:47,042
If the principal
doesn't go to see him,

773
00:45:47,084 --> 00:45:49,167
he'll sell the
children into slavery.

774
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:54,167
Hurry, find the principal,

775
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,917
tell Sgt. Po.

776
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:30,542
Great.

777
00:46:32,084 --> 00:46:34,626
I want the principal
and you bring a pole.

778
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:38,084
Just great.

779
00:46:39,251 --> 00:46:40,376
And the principal?

780
00:46:41,126 --> 00:46:42,292
On his way.

781
00:46:43,167 --> 00:46:44,042
First let the kids go.

782
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:45,959
Okay?

783
00:46:46,292 --> 00:46:47,792
Dad,Dad!

784
00:46:49,501 --> 00:46:50,376
Shut up!

785
00:46:50,501 --> 00:46:51,709
Son, don't be afraid.

786
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:53,751
I'm here.

787
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:56,042
Ah, so this is your son?

788
00:46:56,459 --> 00:46:59,209
Lucky. I was hoping to get him.

789
00:47:00,167 --> 00:47:01,334
Let him out.

790
00:47:04,709 --> 00:47:05,584
Stand straight.

791
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:06,834
Shush.

792
00:47:07,334 --> 00:47:08,334
Calm down,

793
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:11,417
kid, come here.

794
00:47:12,751 --> 00:47:13,626
Ah Sang,

795
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:15,917
the kids aren't to blame.

796
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,292
Don't mess with them, okay?

797
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:20,167
How am I messing with them?

798
00:47:21,084 --> 00:47:22,626
I'm giving him an apple.

799
00:47:25,334 --> 00:47:27,376
Don't be afraid,
have some apple.

800
00:47:27,709 --> 00:47:28,709
Just

801
00:47:29,626 --> 00:47:31,334
tell Dad to put down the pole.

802
00:47:31,376 --> 00:47:33,042
Then we can talk.

803
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,876
Ching, don't be afraid.

804
00:47:34,917 --> 00:47:36,376
Put down the pole.

805
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:42,584
Act like you mean it.

806
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:43,792
On your knees.

807
00:47:49,251 --> 00:47:50,084
Kowtow.

808
00:47:56,001 --> 00:47:57,709
Master Ip?

809
00:48:03,292 --> 00:48:04,334
Hey -

810
00:48:04,709 --> 00:48:06,126
What're you doing here?

811
00:48:06,542 --> 00:48:07,834
There's no fight today.

812
00:48:08,209 --> 00:48:09,251
You took my boy.

813
00:48:09,667 --> 00:48:11,501
Master! Master!

814
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:13,459
Help me!

815
00:48:13,751 --> 00:48:14,501
Ah Fong

816
00:48:15,334 --> 00:48:17,001
So he's your boy -

817
00:48:17,042 --> 00:48:20,084
Sorry. He's one of
ours - let him go.

818
00:48:22,376 --> 00:48:23,959
Lucky it was me who took him.

819
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:25,876
Anything could've happened.

820
00:48:38,167 --> 00:48:39,876
Leave it alone. Go!

821
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:44,084
Ip Man,

822
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:46,084
you're a good fighter, yes?

823
00:48:46,751 --> 00:48:48,584
Can you take on ten men?

824
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:50,876
Don't say I never
gave you a chance.

825
00:48:51,959 --> 00:48:54,042
One against ten...

826
00:48:54,459 --> 00:48:55,792
or say eleven.

827
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,917
With every punch you land

828
00:48:58,417 --> 00:49:00,417
I'll give him a piece to eat.

829
00:49:51,709 --> 00:49:55,334
Master, they still
have my friends.

830
00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:39,542
Why are you back?

831
00:50:40,042 --> 00:50:41,751
To pick the kids up from school.

832
00:51:16,001 --> 00:51:16,876
Bastard.

833
00:51:49,209 --> 00:51:50,042
Move.

834
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:56,459
Over here.

835
00:52:12,584 --> 00:52:13,501
Get him!

836
00:52:22,792 --> 00:52:24,584
Another step and I'll kill him.

837
00:52:24,626 --> 00:52:25,667
Dad!

838
00:52:31,376 --> 00:52:32,376
Bite him.

839
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:38,417
What the...?!

840
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:43,834
Go!

841
00:52:56,501 --> 00:52:58,667
Grab the kid, hurry.

842
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:21,459
Over there, quick!

843
00:53:27,209 --> 00:53:28,209
Dad!

844
00:53:28,334 --> 00:53:29,459
Dad! Dad!

845
00:53:46,292 --> 00:53:47,876
David, don't just stand there!

846
00:53:47,917 --> 00:53:50,209
Grab that kid.

847
00:54:09,042 --> 00:54:10,417
Dad!

848
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:23,542
Kneel. Don't move.

849
00:54:25,042 --> 00:54:26,876
Kneel

850
00:54:29,792 --> 00:54:30,959
Don't move.

851
00:54:31,209 --> 00:54:32,376
Kneel

852
00:54:32,417 --> 00:54:34,167
- Hear me?
- I'm not with them.

853
00:54:44,209 --> 00:54:47,084
Don't move! No one move!

854
00:54:48,626 --> 00:54:50,126
Police. Don't move!

855
00:54:50,251 --> 00:54:52,292
No one move!

856
00:54:52,584 --> 00:54:54,459
Go in and take photos.

857
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,667
Don't move!

858
00:54:57,292 --> 00:55:00,084
All those guys over there.

859
00:55:00,584 --> 00:55:01,542
They'll make great news photos.

860
00:55:01,584 --> 00:55:03,459
Great headline material.

861
00:55:04,667 --> 00:55:06,626
Get 'em all.

862
00:55:09,501 --> 00:55:11,667
I said don't move!

863
00:55:27,709 --> 00:55:28,834
Mama

864
00:55:29,584 --> 00:55:30,251
Mama!

865
00:55:30,292 --> 00:55:31,334
Ah Ching!

866
00:55:47,209 --> 00:55:49,084
There was trouble at the school.

867
00:55:51,751 --> 00:55:53,626
They abducted Ah Ching.

868
00:55:56,334 --> 00:55:57,751
I'm so sorry, Wing Sing.

869
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:03,042
It's my fault

870
00:56:05,959 --> 00:56:07,251
I was wrong.

871
00:56:12,251 --> 00:56:13,667
It's my fault.

872
00:56:15,209 --> 00:56:16,959
It won't happen again,

873
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:18,959
okay?

874
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:33,001
Go wash your face.

875
00:56:33,042 --> 00:56:33,626
Okay.

876
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:34,876
Good kid.

877
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:02,751
It's all my fault.

878
00:57:04,876 --> 00:57:05,959
Don't cry.

879
00:57:06,084 --> 00:57:09,001
Darling, I'm so afraid.

880
00:57:11,751 --> 00:57:13,001
It's all right now.

881
00:57:14,584 --> 00:57:17,167
But I might not be.

882
00:57:24,917 --> 00:57:26,084
What do you mean?

883
00:57:34,042 --> 00:57:35,751
The doctor said...

884
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:39,292
I probably...

885
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:41,917
have cancer.

886
00:57:56,459 --> 00:57:59,459
The black spots
indicate cancer cells.

887
00:57:59,584 --> 00:58:00,834
These are tumors.

888
00:58:00,876 --> 00:58:03,042
The cancer has spread too widely

889
00:58:03,126 --> 00:58:05,751
for us to be able to operate.

890
00:58:17,001 --> 00:58:18,667
Is it curable?

891
00:58:20,084 --> 00:58:22,709
Normally, we'd
prescribe medicines

892
00:58:23,001 --> 00:58:24,709
but at this stage,

893
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,417
they're unlikely to
get it under control.

894
00:58:30,334 --> 00:58:33,626
Doctor, how much time do I have?

895
00:58:34,584 --> 00:58:36,376
Maybe six months.

896
00:59:18,876 --> 00:59:20,792
I'll get you more rice.

897
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:30,667
Just half.

898
01:00:35,084 --> 01:00:36,459
Don't worry, you're safe.

899
01:00:36,542 --> 01:00:37,792
The police are on your side.

900
01:00:37,876 --> 01:00:40,667
Every day there's a new
story in the paper.

901
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:43,709
Abducted children,

902
01:00:43,792 --> 01:00:46,834
people being thrown
from their homes.

903
01:00:46,917 --> 01:00:48,167
My boss is unhappy.

904
01:00:48,251 --> 01:00:49,501
And when my boss is unhappy,

905
01:00:49,584 --> 01:00:50,501
I am unhappy-

906
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:51,876
So-

907
01:00:52,042 --> 01:00:53,417
for the time being all this

908
01:00:53,459 --> 01:00:55,542
nefarious vice and corruption

909
01:00:55,584 --> 01:00:58,001
that you so love to
engage yourself in -

910
01:00:58,084 --> 01:00:59,709
you'll have to take a hiatus.

911
01:00:59,751 --> 01:01:00,709
Otherwise...

Frankie,

01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:05,834
I can't protect you.

915
01:01:06,459 --> 01:01:07,876

916
01:01:07,917 --> 01:01:08,709
Yes.

Well, Frankie,

918
01:01:10,417 --> 01:01:12,459
these chats are
always a pleasure.

919
01:01:12,959 --> 01:01:14,251
Cheerio.

920
01:01:22,084 --> 01:01:23,334
Hey Boss!

921
01:01:23,834 --> 01:01:25,334
This Thai guy's incredible.

922
01:01:25,417 --> 01:01:26,917
Elbows, knees,
fists - all great.

923
01:01:26,959 --> 01:01:27,709
Really fierce.

924
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:28,792
Put it up

925
01:01:28,834 --> 01:01:30,667
It's my mistake, Boss.

926
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,542
I just meant to give
the principal a scare

927
01:01:32,626 --> 01:01:33,834
Not to create such a mess.

928
01:01:33,876 --> 01:01:34,709
Ip Man - it's all his fault.

929
01:01:35,042 --> 01:01:35,834
I'm sorry.

930
01:01:42,751 --> 01:01:45,126
I don't ever want to
see your face again.

931
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:46,292
Fuck off!

932
01:01:51,626 --> 01:01:53,126
Ip Man.

933
01:01:54,251 --> 01:01:55,917
Finish him off!

934
01:05:12,792 --> 01:05:13,667
Get out.

935
01:05:56,709 --> 01:05:58,001
Want any tea?

936
01:05:58,959 --> 01:06:01,251
Listen, things
have quieted down.

937
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:04,001
I'm not expecting more trouble.

938
01:06:04,209 --> 01:06:05,417
But-

can't be trusted.

it out for you.

942
01:06:30,792 --> 01:06:32,792
So smart.

943
01:06:39,501 --> 01:06:41,042
Mom, look!

944
01:07:05,251 --> 01:07:07,084
You want me, I'm here.

945
01:07:07,209 --> 01:07:08,709
What do you want?

946
01:07:17,126 --> 01:07:19,167
So you're Ip Man?

947
01:07:20,042 --> 01:07:22,584
You're the best
fighter in China.

948
01:07:23,042 --> 01:07:24,834
Interesting.

949
01:07:27,709 --> 01:07:29,501
Okay, let's deal.

950
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:34,292
It seems your Wing
Chun is the fastest

951
01:07:34,834 --> 01:07:37,292
so fast you're invincible.

952
01:07:38,667 --> 01:07:41,084
Let's see whose
fists are fastest.

953
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:42,167
Yours?

954
01:07:42,209 --> 01:07:43,792
Or mine?

955
01:07:44,084 --> 01:07:46,292
Three minutes.

956
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:49,376
If you last

957
01:07:50,126 --> 01:07:52,292
I'll let you be.

958
01:11:38,209 --> 01:11:40,292
Hey, how ya doin'?

959
01:11:40,334 --> 01:11:43,126
I want my balloon back.

960
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:45,501
Let it go, don't worry about it.

961
01:11:45,542 --> 01:11:47,626
We'll get a new one, okay?

962
01:11:47,751 --> 01:11:49,542
A new balloon.

963
01:12:02,459 --> 01:12:03,709
Madame -

964
01:12:04,251 --> 01:12:05,501
here's my rent.

965
01:12:06,292 --> 01:12:08,876
I always said you'd come good!

966
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:12,334
Best of luck! You'll
be raking it in!

967
01:12:12,376 --> 01:12:15,792
Great! I can practice
Wing Chun here!

968
01:12:16,334 --> 01:12:18,292
Master - respect!

969
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:19,876
Respect!

970
01:12:19,959 --> 01:12:22,376
Sir, you teach Wing Chun?

971
01:12:22,501 --> 01:12:24,626
You must know Ip Man, yes?

972
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:26,792
Look, today's newspaper -

973
01:12:26,876 --> 01:12:28,376
he's in the news.

974
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:31,167
He's so impressive.

975
01:12:31,584 --> 01:12:33,626
I bet you two are great friends.

976
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:35,251
Introduce me sometime.

977
01:12:36,126 --> 01:12:38,542
Here's the key. I'll leave you.

978
01:12:38,751 --> 01:12:40,292
Don't forget to introduce me!

979
01:12:48,001 --> 01:12:51,001

Can you write about me too?

985
01:13:08,709 --> 01:13:10,626
I've seen Ip Man's kungfu

986
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:13,584
it's not authentic Wing Chun.

987
01:13:13,709 --> 01:13:14,917
I'll challenge him
to a public match.

All the kungfu schools

989

respect Ip Man's Wing Chun.

990
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:20,792
Sure, I'll write something.

991
01:13:21,167 --> 01:13:23,334
But we'll see if the
kungfu world...

992
01:13:23,584 --> 01:13:26,167
will think you're qualified

to publicly challenge Ip Man?

994
01:13:43,042 --> 01:13:43,959
Have a seat, Master.

995
01:13:46,209 --> 01:13:47,376
Got your camera?

996
01:13:52,001 --> 01:13:53,501
Nice tea today.

just say the word.

Master Cheung,

1012
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:48,209
you're fighting everyone

and take along photographers.

1014
01:15:50,209 --> 01:15:52,001
You don't worry
people will talk?

1015
01:15:54,001 --> 01:15:57,626
I know lots of people think

1016
01:15:57,751 --> 01:16:00,042
I'm a show-off,

1017
01:16:00,126 --> 01:16:01,792
that I act superior.

But in kungfu

Ip Man

1022
01:16:12,084 --> 01:16:13,167
can't represent Wing Chun.

01:16:20,126 --> 01:16:22,876
I'm challenging Ip
Man to a fight!

1026
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,126
"Grandmaster of Wing Chun"

1027
01:16:29,042 --> 01:16:30,626
Extra, extra.

1028
01:16:30,709 --> 01:16:32,751
Wing Chun vs. Wing Chun

1029
01:16:32,792 --> 01:16:34,584
- Get your paper.
- I'll have one.

1030
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:39,334
"CHEUNG TIN CHI
CHALLENGES IP MAN"

1031
01:16:39,376 --> 01:16:41,459
"WHOSE IS THE TRUE WING CHUN?"

1032
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:55,084
Darling, it's so ridiculous.

1033
01:16:56,667 --> 01:16:59,542
It's like the joke about Ah Mo.

1034
01:16:59,584 --> 01:17:02,126
He's dining with friends.
He says:

1035
01:17:02,209 --> 01:17:04,501
We're all henpecked.

1036
01:17:04,542 --> 01:17:05,376
Want proof?

1037
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:09,167
If your wife is the
boss, sit over there.

1038
01:17:09,251 --> 01:17:10,917
All the men, heads
held low, went over.

1039
01:17:10,959 --> 01:17:13,167
Only Mo stayed where he was.

1040
01:17:13,292 --> 01:17:14,376
They said,

1041
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:17,376
wow, Mo, you're The Man!

1042
01:17:17,501 --> 01:17:19,292
Know what Mo said? He said,

1043
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:20,376
well, my wife told me:

1044
01:17:20,417 --> 01:17:22,542
Don't sit in crowded places.

1045
01:17:22,834 --> 01:17:24,501
Funny, right?

1046
01:17:25,626 --> 01:17:27,417
Are you scared of your wife?

1047
01:17:27,792 --> 01:17:29,376
Sometimes.

1048
01:17:46,292 --> 01:17:47,542
Next.

1049
01:17:49,959 --> 01:17:51,751
Are you Cheung Wing Sing?

1050
01:17:55,751 --> 01:17:58,667
Why'd God make women
pretty but dumb?

1051
01:17:59,792 --> 01:18:01,376
They're pretty

1052
01:18:01,417 --> 01:18:03,542
so men will like them.

1053
01:18:03,626 --> 01:18:05,626
They're dumb

1054
01:18:05,792 --> 01:18:08,042
so they will like men.

1055
01:18:15,834 --> 01:18:17,292
Look, someone's
challenging Ip Man -

1056
01:18:17,334 --> 01:18:18,626
- When?
- Next month, on the 15th.

1057
01:18:19,417 --> 01:18:21,126
Harder.

1058
01:18:21,792 --> 01:18:22,709
Relax the shoulders, punch fast.

1059
01:18:28,876 --> 01:18:30,751
This way, Master Cheung.

1060
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,126
I want to sit there.

1061
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:33,459
"Master Ip"

1062
01:18:44,834 --> 01:18:45,542
Excuse me.

1063
01:18:49,709 --> 01:18:52,709
Master Ip, what're
you doing here?

1064
01:18:52,959 --> 01:18:54,876
I'm looking for Mr Chan.

1065
01:18:55,917 --> 01:18:57,709
You want to learn to dance?

1066
01:18:57,834 --> 01:18:59,792
I dance better than him.

1067
01:18:59,917 --> 01:19:01,042
I'll teach you.

1068
01:19:01,084 --> 01:19:02,792
And you can teach me kungfu.

1069
01:19:04,292 --> 01:19:06,292
Sure. Now?

1070
01:19:06,917 --> 01:19:07,542
Okay.

1071
01:19:10,417 --> 01:19:12,959
When will you accept
me as a disciple?

1072
01:19:13,709 --> 01:19:14,709
You got it all wrong.

1073
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,751
I didn't say I
wouldn't accept you.

1074
01:19:18,167 --> 01:19:19,584
I didn't open the door

1075
01:19:19,917 --> 01:19:21,626
so you'd leave.

1076
01:19:29,917 --> 01:19:31,126
Thank you.

1077
01:19:31,501 --> 01:19:32,292
Welcome.

1078
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:35,626
Wing Chun vs. Wing Chun
- who's the real deal?

1079
01:19:35,709 --> 01:19:39,209
It's an historic
day for Wing Chun.

1080
01:19:39,376 --> 01:19:42,376
It will be like a
battle of dragons!

1081
01:19:42,626 --> 01:19:45,667
Yes! ls Ip Man the
greater fighter?

1082
01:19:45,751 --> 01:19:48,626
Or is Cheung Tin
Chi fiercer still?

1083
01:19:48,792 --> 01:19:51,959
Who represents the
true Wing Chun?

1084
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:53,417
Today at 3:00pm.

1085
01:19:53,459 --> 01:19:55,167
The contest will begun.

1086
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:57,376
We wait with bated breath.

1087
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:58,209
Sgt. Po. Sgt. Po!

1088
01:19:58,251 --> 01:19:59,042
- Brother - Master Tin

1089
01:19:59,084 --> 01:20:00,001
- Ah-Lik - Where's Master Ip?

1090
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:00,917
No idea!

1091
01:20:01,376 --> 01:20:03,209
What's the problem?

1092
01:20:03,251 --> 01:20:04,167
Maybe he's lost?

1093
01:20:04,292 --> 01:20:07,792
Relax, Ip Man won't let us down.

1094
01:20:08,792 --> 01:20:09,792
I'm here.

1095
01:20:30,917 --> 01:20:34,126
It's 3:00pm. Why
isn't Ip Man here?

1096
01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:38,251
It's time.

1097
01:20:38,376 --> 01:20:39,417
It's time.

1098
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:40,917
Look, it's three.

1099
01:20:53,584 --> 01:20:55,209
Where's your master?

1100
01:20:59,751 --> 01:21:01,042
Gentlemen -

1101
01:21:01,334 --> 01:21:04,167
the match was
scheduled for 3:00pm.

1102
01:21:04,501 --> 01:21:06,542
Since Ip Man has
failed to show up

1103
01:21:06,626 --> 01:21:07,959
I hereby announce

1104
01:21:08,542 --> 01:21:12,792
the victor and true
spirit of Wing Chun

1105
01:21:13,584 --> 01:21:14,917
Cheung Tin Chi.

1106
01:21:16,417 --> 01:21:17,334
Dad! Dad!

1107
01:21:17,376 --> 01:21:19,751
We won! We won!

1108
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:22,292
Maybe he's stuck in traffic?

1109
01:21:22,542 --> 01:21:24,251
And this makes you
a grandmaster?

1110
01:21:26,626 --> 01:21:29,126
Master Cheung, what
do have to say

1111
01:21:29,209 --> 01:21:30,042
about Ip Man's no-show today?

1112
01:21:35,626 --> 01:21:37,834
To mess with classic Wing Chun

1113
01:21:38,542 --> 01:21:42,042
is to lose the
forefathers' vision.

1114
01:21:43,292 --> 01:21:45,376
It's wrong both now

1115
01:21:45,459 --> 01:21:47,251
and into the future as well.

1116
01:21:47,709 --> 01:21:50,792
Our forefathers don't need worry

1117
01:21:51,334 --> 01:21:52,959
about the form's future.

1118
01:21:53,792 --> 01:21:56,751
I believe Master Ip
understands this.

1119
01:21:56,834 --> 01:21:59,334
So he chose to
forfeit the fight.

1120
01:21:59,959 --> 01:22:01,459
This is also an act
of great merit.

1121
01:22:03,709 --> 01:22:05,667
From today,

1122
01:22:06,876 --> 01:22:08,251
I, Cheung Tin Chi

1123
01:22:08,917 --> 01:22:12,209
will lead the true Wing Chun

1124
01:22:14,126 --> 01:22:14,959
to a glorious future.

1125
01:22:15,001 --> 01:22:17,084
- Bravo.
- True Wing Chun.

1126
01:22:17,126 --> 01:22:19,376
What'd you say?

1127
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:21,167
You've no right to that claim -

1128
01:22:21,209 --> 01:22:22,584
you aren't qualified
to fight my master!

1129
01:22:30,126 --> 01:22:31,959
- Settle down, stop.
- Stop.

1130
01:22:54,167 --> 01:22:55,917
Wing Sing! Wing Sing!

1131
01:22:58,584 --> 01:23:01,084
Please, someone
call an ambulance!

1132
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:14,001
Mr Ip, her condition
is worsening.

1133
01:23:14,417 --> 01:23:17,334
She needs to stay in
hospital for a bit.

1134
01:23:43,459 --> 01:23:45,376
Well? Feeling any better?

1135
01:23:48,834 --> 01:23:50,917
When can we go home?

1136
01:23:52,417 --> 01:23:54,584
The doctor said it's better

1137
01:23:54,876 --> 01:23:56,459
for you to stay here.

1138
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:03,792
You need rest.

1139
01:24:44,376 --> 01:24:45,251
473

1140
01:24:45,292 --> 01:24:47,417
85... no, you're right.

1141
01:25:00,584 --> 01:25:01,667
Give the letter to Cheung Fong.

1142
01:25:01,709 --> 01:25:02,542
Tell him to give it to his dad.

1143
01:25:02,792 --> 01:25:03,876
Okay.

1144
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:10,542
Nurse, nurse!

1145
01:25:10,876 --> 01:25:12,917
What it is it, madam?

1146
01:25:13,001 --> 01:25:14,417
Are you in pain?

1147
01:25:14,459 --> 01:25:16,626
Don't worry, I'll
get the doctor.

1148
01:25:26,834 --> 01:25:29,334
Have some bullfrog soup -

1149
01:25:31,334 --> 01:25:33,251
it's good for you.

1150
01:25:53,542 --> 01:25:55,042
Darling -

1151
01:25:56,626 --> 01:26:00,042
I want a photograph with you.

1152
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:13,792
You spend every day with me.

1153
01:27:13,834 --> 01:27:15,959
It makes me so happy.

1154
01:27:18,126 --> 01:27:20,459
But I could be happier.

1155
01:27:24,084 --> 01:27:25,959
People say:

1156
01:27:27,167 --> 01:27:32,501
Life belongs to you,
and it doesn't.

1157
01:27:34,251 --> 01:27:37,209
I didn't get it before.

1158
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:42,876
But now, I'm beginning to.

1159
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:47,709
You belong to yourself.

1160
01:27:48,667 --> 01:27:51,042
And to this family.

1161
01:27:52,376 --> 01:27:54,792
But to this place as well.

1162
01:27:56,709 --> 01:28:00,292
There are things you should do.

1163
01:28:00,792 --> 01:28:04,709
I don't want you
to have regrets.

1164
01:28:13,959 --> 01:28:17,292
I only regret not
being better to you.

1165
01:28:19,834 --> 01:28:20,584
But I think...

1166
01:28:20,626 --> 01:28:23,251
you've been great to me.

1167
01:28:26,251 --> 01:28:28,751
If it wasn't for my sickness,

1168
01:28:29,209 --> 01:28:31,251
would you have taken
the challenge?

1169
01:28:49,626 --> 01:28:50,834
Yes.

1170
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:57,209
That's the Ip Man I love.

1171
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:01,959
I've taken the liberty

1172
01:29:02,251 --> 01:29:04,834
of setting the date with him.

1173
01:29:15,209 --> 01:29:18,626
I haven't heard you
practice in ages.

1174
01:29:19,834 --> 01:29:22,751
Will you let me hear
that sound again?

1175
01:32:29,959 --> 01:32:31,459
Wing Chun,

1176
01:32:31,584 --> 01:32:32,667
Cheung Tin Chi.

1177
01:32:36,334 --> 01:32:37,584
Wing Chun,

1178
01:32:37,751 --> 01:32:39,084
Ip Man.

1179
01:34:08,501 --> 01:34:10,751
- Ip Ching, the back way - Okay.

1180
01:39:31,167 --> 01:39:33,459
I recognise that I'm defeated.

1181
01:39:39,084 --> 01:39:40,917
There's nothing more important

1182
01:39:43,042 --> 01:39:45,209
than the love of
those by your side.

1183
01:40:50,959 --> 01:40:55,501
"Ip Man's wife Cheung Wing Sing"

1184
01:40:55,542 --> 01:40:59,626
"passed away in
1960 from cancer."

1185
01:41:32,751 --> 01:41:34,876
"Ip Man taught Ip Ching Wing Chun.
Martial arts guided his life."

1186
01:41:34,917 --> 01:41:36,167
"Ip Man became a Grandmaster."

1187
01:41:36,209 --> 01:41:37,792
"Wing Chun has flourished,
